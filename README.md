My Data Structures practice and Codes using JAVA
This repository contains my Java code files for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I've covered various data structures, including arrays, arrayLists, strings, stringBuilders, trees, graphs, BST, stack, queue, and heap. The code includes practice problems sourced from platforms such as HackerRank, HackerEarth, Leetcode, Codeforces, and CodeChef.
