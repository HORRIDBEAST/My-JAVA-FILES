for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    for (int k = i + 1; k < a.length; k++) {
        if (a[i] == a[k]) {
            //do stuff
        }
    }
}

so if you have the indices [1...5] the comparison would go

1 -> 2
1 -> 3
1 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 3
2 -> 4
2 -> 5
3 -> 4
3 -> 5
4 -> 5
So you see pairs aren't repeated. Think of a circle of people all needing to shake hands with each other.
